personal_site
=============

About:
This is a site highlighting my work as a musician and web developer.  This the first site that I have built from scratch using all the skills that I have gained over the past three months in attending Nashville Software School. 
It is a one page site that has defined sections using static backgrounds and layout.

Build Methods:
Framework and Layout:  Foundation 4,
Google Fonts: Roboto,
Project Modal:  Bootstrap,
YouTube & Sound Cloud APIs,
CSS3, mailchimp email sign up
jQuery,
Javascript





Punch List:
The entire site needs a lot of refining of line spacing, font size, margins, and element placement. 
- bug with using nav staying displayed when trying to clikc on it on music, developer, and contact pages.
- auto scroll feature needs to be added to links on home page and nav bar.
- layout of music page needs to be reworked
- design tweaks on Dev Page. ex: line spacing, modal size
- contact section needs to expanded with more content
